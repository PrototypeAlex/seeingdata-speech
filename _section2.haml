      Imagine you come across a visualiastion you've never before seen.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      Through a flood sensory information we begin <strong>examine</strong> the visualisation.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      Your <strong>focus</strong> jumps around the place and builds a mental model of the image.

      Imagine you come across a visualisation you've never before seen.
      %br
      %br
    %li{:style => 'opacity: 0.4;'}
      Then through a flood sensory information we begin <strong>examine</strong> the visualisation.
      %br
      %br
    %li{:style => 'opacity: 0.4;'}
      Your <strong>focus</strong> jumps around the place and builds a mental model of the image.

      %br
    %li.slide
      The way in which the visualisation presents the data to the eye is called the viewing architecture.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      The process up until now has occurred in your brains visual cortex, and all happened insanely fast.

      You have no inherent meaning of the information, however your brain quickly maps it against past <strong>memories</strong>.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      This is where we begin to transition away from the visual cortex toward the cerebral cortex.

      We then analyze the information, and think about what it means to us.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      This is substantially slower and less efficient than the visual processing.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      Traditional data presentation made heavy use of <strong>thinking</strong> (i.e. cognition).

    Data visualisation shifts the balance towards greater use of visual perception.

    Leveraging the Visual Cortex

      Psychology has made significant leeway on how our brain processes visual information.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      The more we push onto the visual cortex, the more we analytical sense-making we can push onto the cerebral cortex.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      The Gastalt School of Psychology have several principles that show how our brain organizes data.

      This means we can encode massive amounts of information visually, it's currently the best weapon we have in the fight against big data.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      These techniques are good, but they are just one part of a large puzzle.

    Visualisation Form
  %ul
    %li.slide
      Statistical data is abstract, our goal is to give it form to communicate a story, a concept, an idea.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      The form can take many shapes, each can tell a different story from the same data.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      Tables do two things well, they express values precisely, and provide an excellent means to lookup values.

      But what if I want to tell the story of New Zealand's unemployment rate over 15 years?

      Instantly we are able to see patterns, trends and the beginnings of s story unfolds.
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      You might also start asking yourself questions, such as:
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      What caused the drop leading to 2008?
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      Why are we climbing back up towards our unemployment peak?
      %br
      %br
    %li.slide
      Unfortunately I'm don't hold the answers to these questions. (Any economists in the room?)
